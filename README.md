<h1>test</h1>

Hello random person this repl was made by a middle school student and was meant to serve one purpose only: to try and use javascript on ChromeOS 115+ without any stops. 
#
FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T FORK & RUN

The repl.dev is <a href="https://02cb233f-4c74-47dd-9a7e-be60c1c1dbd7-00-3bb82z4yi9r9k.kirk.replit.dev/">here</a>

<h2>Kill-Curly</h2>

A piece of code stolen from some random dude on github who said they could create cookies that block the blockers of Securly. Code of Kill-Curly was stolen <a href="https://github.com/zek-c/Securly-Kill-V111/">here</a>

<h2>Insecurly</h2>

Appearently the solution for the ChromeOS 115+ problem. It just runs scripts on the Securly file "blocked.html". It's code can be found <a href="https://github.com/zek-c/Securly-Kill-V111/main/bypassi.html">here</a>

<h2>Code Runners (not a blookmarket)</h2>

People with chromeOS 115+ need code runners as they can't run any code. 

<h3>Javascript Runner #1</h3>

When I first made this code runner, I didn't know about HTML5 inputs. This is the reason why it brought up a prompt first, asking for code instead of directly getting it from a input. 

<h3>Javascript Runner #2</h3>

When learned about inputs, I immediatly created this JS runner for this reason. It is easier to use (hopefully), and also made me try to make a turn off confirmation button. Didn't work though, so was left with this runner that kept bringing up confirmations.

<h3>HTML5 Runner</h3>
Made this because I was bored.

<h2>HTML5, CSS3, and JS runner</h2>

Never worked on it. Still won't work on it.

<h2>Random Page</h2>

Was the first page I worked on.
####
I made it for nothing.
